Title: Geospatial Spline Visualization and Evaluation for Tram Localization

Description:
This project focuses on visualizing and evaluating height splines for their application in tram localizers. The goal is to analyze and assess the accuracy and effectiveness of height splines in localization tasks related to trams. The provided code allows for the visualization of these splines and facilitates their evaluation on real-world datasets. 

2) simple_tram_odometry:
Title: Visual Odometry Assessment using Optical Flow, Essential Matrix, and Hough Transform for Moscow Tram Datasets

Description:
This project aims to evaluate visual odometry using monocular camera data from Moscow trams. The implementation leverages techniques such as optical flow, essential matrix estimation, and the Hough transform. By utilizing these methods, the code estimates the camera's ego-motion and provides an assessment of the visual odometry performance on the given datasets.

3) stabilizer:
Title: Camera Stabilizer with Key Point Extraction, Inter-frame Motion, and Kalman Filtering

Description:
The stabilizer project focuses on implementing a camera stabilizer that operates in a multithreaded environment. The code extracts key points from consecutive frames, estimates the motion between frames, and utilizes a Kalman filter to stabilize the obtained parameters. The objective is to enhance the stability and smoothness of camera footage.

4) array_memory_manager:
Title: Array Memory Manager - Dynamic Memory Allocation and Automatic Deallocation Utility

Description:
Array Memory Manager is a utility aimed at efficient dynamic memory allocation and automatic deallocation in C++. It allows for dynamic memory allocation on the heap and provides automatic deallocation of the memory if the pointer is no longer in use. By using the Array Memory Manager, developers can avoid memory fragmentation issues and improve memory management in their applications.
